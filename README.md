##  HOW SCAMTRACK WORKS (Behind the Scenes)

SCAMTRACK is more than a flashy CLI ‚Äî it's a trap engine designed to *deliver and log payload activity* using a Flask web server and Ngrok tunnel.

Here‚Äôs exactly what happens when you launch a trap:

1. **Flask Trap Server Starts Locally**
   ‚Üí SCAMTRACK runs a local Flask server on `http://localhost:5000`, ready to serve your HTML or JS-based payloads.
   ‚Üí Payloads are hosted from the `/payloads/` folder ‚Äî this includes things like `ip_grabber.html`, `clipboard_stealer.js`, etc.

2. **Ngrok Connects Your Localhost to the Internet**
   ‚Üí SCAMTRACK auto-launches `ngrok http 5000`, which creates a **public HTTPS link** to your local trap server.
   ‚Üí Example: `https://abc123.ngrok.app ‚Üí http://localhost:5000`

3. **Payload is Tied to Public Link**
   ‚Üí SCAMTRACK gives you a complete trap URL like:
   `https://abc123.ngrok.app/payloads/ip_grabber.html`
   ‚Üí This URL is safe to send to scammers or load into QR codes.

4. **Victim Clicks the Trap**
   ‚Üí When someone clicks your link or scans the QR code:

   * Flask serves the payload
   * JavaScript logs their IP, browser, OS, screen size, etc.
   * Logs are written in real-time to: `logs/tracker_events.log`

5. **Optional Logging + QR Code Creation**
   ‚Üí SCAMTRACK auto-generates a QR code for the payload URL
   ‚Üí Optional Discord alerts can be configured via `webhook_reporter.py`
   ‚Üí You can watch hits in real-time using the `View Live Logs` option.

 All of this happens from a single command:

```bash
python3 scamtrack_cli.py
```
